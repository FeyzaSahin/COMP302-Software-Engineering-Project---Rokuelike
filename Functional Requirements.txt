A screen that appears when the game is opened. There must be three buttons: one to start a new game, one for help, one for exit.
Build mode: appears when a new game is started from the starting screen. 4 halls of the game should be shown. Selected hall should be highlighted after tapping on it once and the requirements for that hall should appear on the screen. Then the players can tap on the objects and the objects should be highlighted. Tapping a highligted object again should remove the highlight and selecting another object from the menu should also remove the previous highlight and highlight the new object. Tapping to a square on the highlighted room when an object is highlighted should place the object there if placing that object there is allowed. If the object is placed, the highlight of the object in the selection bar should disappear. If the object placement is not allowed (like placement of object creates a subsection of the room that can't be reached, will be discussed further) some sort of warning that the object can't be placed because of the {reason} should appear for a few seconds, highlight should stay and the object should not be placed. In the build mode, there should be the following buttons when working on a specific hall: clear (removes all objects), remove last placed, save (removes the highlight, stays in the build menu), save and start (opens the play mode in that hall only if: enough objects are placed and all the previous halls are completed, possible further conditions).
